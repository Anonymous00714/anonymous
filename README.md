## Lung Cancer Detection App

### Overview
This mobile application leverages advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Grad-CAM for early lung cancer detection from CT scan images. The app provides:
- Classification of lung CT images into **Malignant**, **Benign**, or **Normal**.
- Heatmap visualizations of areas critical to predictions.
- A detailed prediction report for healthcare practitioners.

### Features
- **Cosine Similarity Validation**: Ensures only valid lung CT scans are submitted.
- **Grad-CAM Visualizations**: Enhances interpretability by showing the areas influencing model predictions.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Designed for both clinical and non-clinical users.
